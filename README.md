# Musical Instrument Recognition System using Artificial Intelligence 


In this project, Artificial Neural Networks were trained to classify a range of musical instruments and a number of comparative experiments were conducted on how much different characteristics of the musical instruments would impact the resulting accuracy. These experiments were, using:

* The whole sample
* The attack of the sound
* Everything but the attack of the sound
* The initial 100 Hz of the frequency spectrum
* The following 900 Hz of the frequency spectrum
